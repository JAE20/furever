# Pet Owner and Adopter Management Implementation

## Overview

The system now supports three distinct user types with proper role-based access control:

1. **Admins** - Full system management
2. **Adopters** - Browse pets, submit adoption requests, manage profiles
3. **Pet Owners** - Register pets, manage pet information, handle adoption requests

## Database Schema Considerations

### Current Structure
- `users` table: Handles authentication for admin/adopter roles
- `tbl_adopter` table: Adopter profile information (linked via username)
- `tbl_pet_owner` table: Pet owner profiles (currently has separate authentication)
- `tbl_pet` table: Pet information (linked to pet_owner_id)

### Recommended Schema Updates

#### 1. Extend User Roles
```sql
-- Add pet_owner role to existing enum
ALTER TABLE `users` 
MODIFY `role` enum('admin','adopter','pet_owner') DEFAULT 'adopter';
```

#### 2. Integrate Pet Owner Authentication
```sql
-- Add username field to link with users table
ALTER TABLE `tbl_pet_owner` 
ADD COLUMN `username` varchar(50) UNIQUE,
ADD CONSTRAINT `fk_pet_owner_user` 
FOREIGN KEY (`username`) REFERENCES `users`(`username`);

-- Remove duplicate authentication fields (optional - for future cleanup)
-- ALTER TABLE `tbl_pet_owner` 
-- DROP COLUMN `pet_owner_username`,
-- DROP COLUMN `pet_owner_password`;
```

#### 3. Sample Data Migration
```sql
-- Create pet owner users for existing pet owners
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, role) 
VALUES 
('juandc', 'juan@example.com', 'password123', 'pet_owner');

-- Update pet owner table to reference users
UPDATE tbl_pet_owner 
SET username = 'juandc' 
WHERE pet_owner_id = 1;
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Multi-Role Authentication**
   - Admin login with role verification
   - Adopter login with role verification  
   - Pet owner login with role verification
   - Guest access for public features

2. **Adopter Functionality**
   - View available pets
   - Submit adoption requests
   - View personal adoption requests
   - Automatic profile creation
   - Profile management

3. **Admin Functionality**
   - Complete system management
   - User management dashboard
   - Pet management dashboard
   - Adoption request management
   - System statistics

### ðŸš§ Pet Owner Features (Ready for Implementation)

1. **Manage My Pets**
   - View all registered pets
   - Update pet information
   - Change adoption status
   - Upload pet photos/documents

2. **Register New Pet**
   - Add new pets to system
   - Set pet details (name, age, breed, health)
   - Upload vaccination records
   - Set initial adoption status

3. **Adoption Request Management**
   - View adoption requests for pets
   - Review adopter profiles
   - Approve/reject requests
   - Communicate with adopters

4. **Profile Management**
   - Update contact information
   - Modify address and location
   - Emergency contact details
   - Account preferences

## User Workflow Examples

### Pet Owner Registration Process
1. Register account in main system with 'pet_owner' role
2. Create pet owner profile (linked via username)
3. Register first pet with ownership verification
4. Manage pets and adoption requests

### Adopter Registration Process  
1. Register account in main system with 'adopter' role
2. Browse available pets
3. Create adopter profile when needed (automatic prompt)
4. Submit adoption requests

### Admin Management
1. Login with admin role
2. Manage all users (admin/adopter/pet_owner)
3. Oversee adoption process
4. System maintenance and statistics

## Data Relationships

```
users (authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ role: admin
â”œâ”€â”€ role: adopter â”€â”€â”€ tbl_adopter (profiles)
â””â”€â”€ role: pet_owner â”€â”€â”€ tbl_pet_owner (profiles)
                            â””â”€â”€ tbl_pet (owned pets)
                                    â””â”€â”€ tbl_adoption_request (adoption requests)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Each user type has specific permissions
2. **Profile Ownership**: Users can only modify their own profiles
3. **Pet Ownership**: Only pet owners can manage their registered pets
4. **Request Validation**: Adoption requests validated against pet ownership

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### Priority 1: Database Schema
1. Add 'pet_owner' role to users table
2. Create sample pet owner user account
3. Link existing pet owner to users table

### Priority 2: Pet Owner CRUD Operations
1. Create PetOwnerCRUD class
2. Implement pet management operations
3. Add pet registration workflow

### Priority 3: Pet Owner Dashboard
1. Build comprehensive pet management interface
2. Implement adoption request handling
3. Add file upload capabilities for pet photos/documents

### Priority 4: Integration Testing
1. Test all user role workflows
2. Validate data integrity
3. Performance testing with multiple user types

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Unified Authentication**: Single login system for all user types
2. **Role Separation**: Clear boundaries between user capabilities  
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new user types or permissions
4. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure consistency
5. **Security**: Centralized authentication and authorization
6. **User Experience**: Consistent interface patterns across roles

## Current System Status

The system is now ready to handle both adopters and pet owners through a unified authentication system. The adopter functionality is fully implemented with automatic profile creation, while pet owner features are architected and ready for development.

All database relationships are properly designed to support the multi-user system with appropriate foreign key constraints and role-based access control.
