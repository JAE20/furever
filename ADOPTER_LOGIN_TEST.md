# Adopter Login Functionality - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Has Been Added

✅ **Updated Login Menu**: Changed from 3 to 4 options:
   1. Admin Login
   2. **Adopter Login** (NEW)
   3. Guest Access (Limited Features)
   4. Exit System

✅ **Adopter Authentication**: Added `adopterLogin()` method that:
   - Prompts for username and password
   - Uses existing `UserCRUD.authenticateUser()` with "adopter" role
   - Shows success/failure messages
   - Redirects to adopter menu on successful login

✅ **Adopter Menu System**: Added `showAdopterMenu()` with options:
   1. View Available Pets
   2. Submit Adoption Request
   3. View My Adoption Requests
   4. Update My Profile
   5. Logout

✅ **Adopter-Specific Features**: Implemented three key methods:

   - **`submitAdoptionRequest()`**: 
     - Shows available pets for adoption
     - Provides information about needing adopter registration
     - Links to existing pet and adoption request systems

   - **`viewMyAdoptionRequests()`**:
     - Finds adopter profile linked to username
     - Shows all adoption requests for this adopter
     - Displays request ID, pet ID, date, status, and approval date

   - **`updateMyProfile()`**:
     - Allows adopters to update contact information
     - Updates email, address, and contact details
     - Preserves existing information if no changes made

## How Adopter Login Works

1. **User Flow**: Login Menu → Choose "2. Adopter Login" → Enter credentials → Adopter Menu
2. **Authentication**: Uses same system as admin login but checks for "adopter" role
3. **Profile Linking**: Links user account to adopter record via username
4. **Feature Access**: Provides adopter-specific functionality while maintaining security

## Testing the System

To test adopter login functionality:

1. Run the system: `./runme` or use the manual commands
2. Choose "2. Adopter Login" from the main menu
3. Enter adopter credentials (must exist in database with role="adopter")
4. Navigate through the adopter menu to test features

## Database Requirements

For adopter login to work, you need:
- User record with `role="adopter"` in the `users` table
- Corresponding adopter record in the `adopters` table
- The adopter record should reference the user via username or user ID

✅ **COMPILED**: All code compiles without errors
✅ **TESTED**: Authentication flow verified, menu structure complete
